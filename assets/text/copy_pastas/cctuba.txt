this is okay, i guess. however, i question your use of a 5/4 CC tuba for it. is the part not perfectly playable on a 3 valve Eb, like i have? you’ve deluded yourself into thinking you “need” bigger equipment. i can blow the Chicago symphony or whoever else you may think of out of the water with my “undersized” horn. just food for thought…
