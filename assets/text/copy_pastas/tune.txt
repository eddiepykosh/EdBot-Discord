I have heard of (factory tuned) tubas.  Does that mean they are tuned to a certain pitch or what?  Is there such a thing as a factory tuned tuba, does the term apply to other brass instruments?
I have a very old tuba - my photo - made in the late 1800s in Grasliz Bohemia for the Carl Fuchs Music Company In Los Angeles, CA.  During tuning I seldom have to tinker with slides on my horn - all comments and questions are welcome.  By the way, many years ago while playing with the Palos Verdes Symphonic Band I was teased about my factory tuned Tuba.
It embarrassed me, I reddened because I thought it was a criticism of my playing.  I’m still not sure what he meant but I’m going on my 56th year playing that same Tuba I purchased from Milt Marcus, a Tuba collector living in Long CA when I was 24.
