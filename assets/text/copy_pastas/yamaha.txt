As I've discussed with you elsewhere, I personally find every single Yamaha horn to be absolute garbage. Lifeless horns with no playability. They only play 'one way' and if you want to, or personally do, play differently, you will not get any better result. In fact it may, and likely will, play worse. I hate, hate, hate the sound of Yamaha low brass. It's so thin, lifeless, and boring. That's because Japanese musical culture values higher voices more than lower voices. That's why there's so much more of the fluff and junk from piccolos and flutes and all that mess in Japanese band literature.
