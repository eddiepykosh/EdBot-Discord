Greetings fellow chatters of Trombone,
I write to you today in lieu of some, lets say…interesting fashion choices I’ve observed Gen Z make over the past couple of auditions I’ve taken. Just the other day I saw a young man show up to an audition in just a sweater and khakis. There wasn’t a single button in site! No buttons! Now if God has taught me one thing it is to never pass judgement on my fellow man. However, this time I couldn’t help but wonder “who does this little youknowwhat think he is??”
The Gen Z media will have you believe that since the audition is “blind” you should “wear whatever you’re comfortable in.” I say shame on you. I cannot count how many lovely conversations I’ve had in musicians lounges waiting for the inevitable “the committee has decided to advance this candidate or that candidate”, that I simply wouldn’t have had had I not been wearing a button down and slacks! There’s a certain respect you earn with your attire in this business before you ever play a note. You never know who might have a gig ready for a handsome, put together trombonist. I mean, will this generation stop at nothing before they break down every barrier separating civil society from savagery?
I’m wondering what the hive thinks about attire for blind auditions. Am I crazy or should you hold on to some dignity behind that screen?
P.S. if someone could get me Steve Shires’ contact info I would really appreciate it. I’ve been working on a 3D printed valve with my nephew that I’d love to get his eyes on now that he’s making trombones again. Thanks.
